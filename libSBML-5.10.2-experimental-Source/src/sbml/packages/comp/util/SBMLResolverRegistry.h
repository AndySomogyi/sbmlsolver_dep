 * @class SBMLResolverRegistry
 * @sbmlbrief{comp} Registry of all SBML resolvers.
 *
 * @htmlinclude libsbml-facility-only-warning.html
 *
 * LibSBML provides facilities for resolving SBML documents in various ways
 * from a given URI. Resolvers are implemented as objects derived from the
 * class SBMLResolver.
 *
 * The resolver registry maintains a list of known resolvers and provides
 * methods for discovering them.  It is implemented as a singleton object of
 * class SBMLResolverRegistry.  Callers can use the method
 * SBMLResolverRegistry::getNumResolvers() to find out how many resolvers are
 * registered, then use SBMLResolverRegistry::getResolverByIndex(@if java
 * int@endif) to iterate over each one;
 *
